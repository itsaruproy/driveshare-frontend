# DriveShare

DriveShare is a web application that helps you upload files from a URL to a configured Google Drive folder. Simply sign in with your Google account, create a target with the Google Drive folder ID, and share the generated link with others to allow them to upload files. The files will be automatically uploaded to the target directory in Google Drive with the help of the [DriveShare backend](https://github.com/itsaruproy/driveshare-backend).
